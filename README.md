*Corrasable* is a web service that packages together tools like [Lingua](http://www.pressure.to/ruby/) and [The CMU Pronouncing Dictionary](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict) to assist in analyzing text and converting it into alternate representations.

Better documentation is coming. Refer to [available routes](https://github.com/dzucconi/corrasable/blob/master/config/routes.rb) in the meantime.
